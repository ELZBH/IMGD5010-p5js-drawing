# Feedback with Caleb Prouty

## Caleb's guess about my english instructions:
```
- Create a canvas and set the background to purple
- Create two yellow squares, one in the top left and the other in the bottom right
- Crop the squares into stars by placing purple circles on each corner of the squares.
```
### Commentary:

The program makes sense (my guess was very similar to your instructions). I like the stars.
Instead of your current implementation, you can use one large circle in the exact middle of the canvas to cover one corner of each square and use that as a guide for sizing the squares and circles

## Updates to the Program

Originally I wanted to implement Caleb's "central circle" idea for using it as a guide, but I had a different goal when I started coding again.
In class, on 1/29, we discussed the draw function, conditionals, and many more p5js capabilities. This inspired me to make a star drawing function and rely on variables. It is my hope that with future classes, I can improve the star drawing program even more, maybe make it responsive to input or load every few frames like a screen saver.
