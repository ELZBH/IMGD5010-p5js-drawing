This repo contains the requisite information for Assignment 2 for IMGD 5010

## Drawing task instructions in English to be translated to code:

### Task Description: Create a few layered shapes in order to place stars in the canvas
```
create a canvas
create a purple background
create a yellow rectangle
layer the rectangle with purple circles to carve out a star
repeat this in a new location on the canvas
```
## Original output plus code
<img width="1113" height="481" alt="Star p5js Elizabeth" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e269dcc-11e8-4238-8355-9e264ccb3c8b" />

## Inspiration:

I've been working with the PAX East team for desiging WPI's booth at PAX East. We chose a wish-granting theme for our marketing materials. This left stars on the mind when attempting to draw, so I wanted a program that drew stars for me.

This solution is rather simplistic, it took me a bit of time to play around with the origins of the circles to properly slice up a rectangle. I also spent time deciding what style of star I wanted in the final output. Check the feedback page for how it improved after sharing with a friend in class.
